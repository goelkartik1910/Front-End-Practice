How to use javascript in html?
1. In-line --> Just use <script></script> tags in body.
2. Link external file. <script src=""></script>

--> Whatever interacts can be done by Javascript.
--> adding timer.
--> dynamically add and remove html elements.
--> Semicolon is not mandatory in JS.
--> OOPS Based

Basic Commands
1. console.log() --> to print anything
2. prompt() --> to take input and show a message.

Variables
1. let --> 
example
    let number = 22;

Operators
1. Unary: which have only 1 operand
    ++, --
2. Binary: which have only 2 operand
    a) Airthmatic Operators
        +, -, /, *, %, **
    b) Comparison Operators
        ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ===
    c) Logical Operators
        &&, ||, !
    4) Bitwise Operators
        &(AND), |(OR), ^(XOR), <<(LEFT SHIFT), >>(RIGHT SHIFT)
    5) Assignement Operator
        =, +=, -+, *=, **=, /=, %=
3. Ternary

"abc" + "xyz" --> abcxyz
"abc" + "xyz" --> abcxyz
`abc` + 'xyz' --> abcxyz
20 + "abc" --> 20abc // it will treat 20 as an another strings
true + "abc" --> trueabc // it will treat true as an another strings
true + 20 --> 21 // as true --> 1 and false --> 0
true + true --> 2 // again the same thing

'' && 10 -->
true && 'abc' --> if 1st is true then it will check what is next and print it
false && anything --> false
undefined && anything --> undefined
false || anything --> anything
true || anything --> true
'' || anything --> anything
!anything --> false
!'' --> true
!0 --> true

Conclusion
1. If one operand is string then it will make it strings
2. If there is no string then it will be number.
3. Comparison operators do not compare data types, they compare data.

What can be the opperands for a comparison operators? 
ans: any data type
What is the result of the comparison operators?
ans: boolean value

Datatypes:
1. undefined
2. number
3. string
4. boolean

Typecasting
1. Number to boolean --> Boolean() 
    Only number 0 will false, remaining all are true.
2. Strings to boolean --> Boolean()
    Empty string -> false, remaining all are true.
3. Number to strings --> String()
    number becomes string
4. Boolean to Strings --> String()
    remains same but as string
5. undefined to Strings --> String()
    remains NAN
6. bool to number --> Number()
    true is 1 and false is 0

If you want to know any typw of datatype then use --> typeof()
